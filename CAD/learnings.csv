LRN-2025-07-23-01,CAD,Fixing Fragmented Arcs from DXF / STEP Imports,"Extruded profiles from STEP files often define arcs as a series of straight segments, which reduces CAD performance and breaks automatic recognition of geometry. To fix this: (1) perform an Extrude on the imported profile; (2) create a new Sketch and use Project on the extruded face; (3) Fusion will automatically convert the sketch into proper arcs.",Always apply this method when reusing external DXF/STEP files
LRN-2025-07-23-02,CAD,Locking Projected Sketches from External Sources,"When a sketch is projected from an external reference (e.g., supplier profile), it should be locked using Fix Constraint (padlock icon) to prevent accidental movement. Do not dimension it, as it's not parametric. The sketch is meant to encapsulate geometry, not drive it.",Always lock projected sketches with `Fix`
LRN-2025-07-23-03,Fusion Timeline,Replacing Sketch Used in Extrusion,To replace a sketch in an existing Extrude feature: (1) create a new sketch in the same plane; (2) move it on the timeline before the Extrude; (3) right-click the Extrude and use Edit Feature; (4) remove the old profile and select the new sketch. This keeps the feature tree clean and maintains consistency.,Use this method when refactoring profiles
LRN-2025-07-23-04,Traceability / CAD,Adding Purchase Link and Part Number to Component,"Each component should include both a product link and a manufacturer part number for traceability and sourcing. In Fusion 360, right-click the component → Properties. In the Description field, enter the URL to the product page. In the Part Number field, enter the manufacturer's catalog number.",Always fill in `Description` with URL and `Part Number` with catalog number
LRN-2025-07-23-05,CAD File Structure,Creating a “Workshop” Folder for Temporary Files,"In the Fusion 360 Project view, a folder named Workshop was created. This folder is used to store temporary files or experiments that might be useful in the future, but are not currently part of the main assembly. It helps keep the workspace clean while retaining access to early concepts, test geometries, or unused ideas.",Use a `Workshop` folder to organize temporary or future-use files
LRN-2025-07-23-06,CAD / Fasteners,Consistent Use of Fasteners in Assemblies,"Fasteners (especially metric screws) should be inserted directly into assemblies using the Insert Fastener command in Fusion 360. They should not be stored as standalone components in part libraries, as they are meaningful only in the context of joining elements. Use Insert Fastener only when the entire fastener stack (e.g., screw, washer, nut) is available in the Fusion library. For non-standard or missing fasteners (e.g. M8x80 headless rod), model the entire connection using standard components. Do not mix Fasteners and manual components in one joint. After insertion, use Properties to fill in: (1) the product URL in Description, (2) the part number in Part Number.","Use Fusion Fasteners only when the full set is available. For custom or partial cases, use modeled components instead. Never mix both methods in one joint. Add sourcing info via `Properties`."
LRN-2025-07-23-07,CAD / Fasteners,When to Use Fusion Fasteners vs. Custom Components,"Fusion’s Insert Fastener should be used when the whole fastener stack (screw, washer, nut) is available in the Fusion library. This enables full auto-insertion, sizing, and hole generation. However, when using non-standard fasteners (e.g. headless M8x80 threaded rods) not available in the Fusion library, it's better to model the entire connection using standard components (as separate parts). Do not mix Fasteners and manual components in one stack — choose one consistent method per joint.","Use Fusion Fasteners only when the full fastener set is available. For non-standard or partial cases, use modeled components. Never mix both approaches within a single connection."
LRN-2025-07-23-08,CAD / Threads,Disable “Modeled” Option When Adding Threads,"When creating custom screws or threaded parts using Edit Feature → Thread, make sure to uncheck the 'Modeled' option. Keeping this option enabled renders the full thread geometry, which significantly slows down the model and increases file size. In most mechanical design workflows, only the thread annotation is needed — not the 3D geometry.",Always uncheck 'Modeled' in the Thread feature to optimize performance
LRN-2025-07-23-09,CAD / Naming Convention,Use Fusion ViewCube Labels to Indicate Component Positions,"The Fusion 360 ViewCube in the top-right corner defines six orientation labels: TOP, FRONT, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, BACK. These labels should be reused when naming identical components placed in different positions within an assembly (e.g. repeated structural elements like trusses). This keeps naming consistent and orientation-intuitive across the project.","Use only ViewCube terms (TOP, FRONT, etc.) to define positional variants of identical components"
LRN-2025-07-23-10,CAD / Traceability,Avoid Problematic URLs in Description Field,"When inserting purchase links into the Description field of a component, avoid using URLs that contain commas or are excessively long. Some suppliers (e.g., Dold Mechatronik) generate links with commas, which can break CSV structure during exports or imports. Use clean, shortened URLs if possible, and test them in a CSV environment to ensure they are parse-safe.","Do not use links with commas in the Description. Use clean, short URLs suitable for CSV handling."
LRN-2025-07-23-11,CAD / QA,Verification of CAD Models Against Real Components,"Before finalizing assemblies or generating manufacturing drawings, the CAD model must be verified against the real parts in stock or purchased. Suppliers may provide outdated or inaccurate CAD files, especially for mechanical elements like profiles, fasteners, and brackets. Visual inspection and dimensional comparison with physical parts ensures that what’s modeled is actually what will be assembled.",Always verify the CAD model with real-world components before release or production
LRN-2025-07-23-12,CAD / Naming,Avoid Embedding Variable Dimensions in File Names,"File names should avoid including values that are parametrically defined, such as length. For example, naming a profile as Profile_40x40x800 is misleading if the 800 mm length is driven by a user parameter. Including such values in the file name may cause confusion and break the abstraction of the parametric model. Static names are acceptable for fixed supplier parts, but not for in-house parametric components.",Do not embed parameter values like length in file names unless the part is static and vendor-defined.
