LRN-2025-07-23-01,CAD,Fixing Fragmented Arcs from DXF / STEP Imports,"Extruded profiles from STEP files often define arcs as a series of straight segments, which reduces CAD performance and breaks automatic recognition of geometry. To fix this: (1) perform an Extrude on the imported profile; (2) create a new Sketch and use Project on the extruded face; (3) Fusion will automatically convert the sketch into proper arcs.",Always apply this method when reusing external DXF/STEP files,Profile Cross Section DOLD.f3d
LRN-2025-07-23-02,CAD,Locking Projected Sketches from External Sources,"When a sketch is projected from an external reference (e.g., supplier profile), it should be locked using Fix Constraint (padlock icon) to prevent accidental movement. Do not dimension it, as it's not parametric. The sketch is meant to encapsulate geometry, not drive it.",Always lock projected sketches with Fix,Profile Cross Section DOLD.f3d
LRN-2025-07-23-03,Fusion Timeline,Replacing Sketch Used in Extrusion,To replace a sketch in an existing Extrude feature: (1) create a new sketch in the same plane; (2) move it on the timeline before the Extrude; (3) right-click the Extrude and use Edit Feature; (4) remove the old profile and select the new sketch. This keeps the feature tree clean and maintains consistency.,Use this method when refactoring profiles,EQ_ProfileAssembly.f3d
LRN-2025-07-23-04,Traceability / CAD,Adding Purchase Link and Part Number to Component,"Each component should include both a product link and a manufacturer part number for traceability and sourcing. In Fusion 360, right-click the component → Properties. In the Description field, enter the URL to the product page. In the Part Number field, enter the manufacturer's catalog number.",Always fill in Description with URL and Part Number with catalog number,Any purchasable component
LRN-2025-07-23-05,CAD File Structure,Creating a “Workshop” Folder for Temporary Files,"In the Fusion 360 Project view, a folder named Workshop was created. This folder is used to store temporary files or experiments that might be useful in the future, but are not currently part of the main assembly.",Use a Workshop folder to organize temporary or future-use files,Project folder structure
LRN-2025-07-23-06,CAD / Fasteners,Using Fasteners Only in Assemblies,"Fasteners (especially metric screws) should only be inserted directly into assemblies, using the Insert Fastener command in Fusion 360. They should not be stored as standalone components in parts libraries or folders, because they are meaningful only in the context of joining elements. After inserting a fastener, right-click its instance → Properties, and enter: (1) product URL in Description, (2) part number in Part Number.",Do not catalogue fasteners as standalone parts. Use Insert Fastener only in assemblies. Fill in sourcing info via Properties.,Any fastener in assembly
LRN-2025-07-23-07,CAD / Fasteners,When to Use Fusion Fasteners vs. Custom Components,"Fusion’s Insert Fastener should be used when the whole fastener stack (screw, washer, nut) is available in the Fusion library. However, for non-standard fasteners not available in the Fusion library (e.g. M8x80 headless rod), it's better to model the entire connection as components. Do not mix Fasteners and manual components in one stack — choose one consistent method per joint.","Use Fusion Fasteners only when the full fastener set is available. For non-standard or partial cases, use modeled components. Never mix both approaches within a single connection.",Assembly with mixed fasteners
LRN-2025-07-23-08,CAD / Threads,Disable “Modeled” Option When Adding Threads,"When creating custom screws or threaded parts using Edit Feature → Thread, make sure to uncheck the 'Modeled' option. Keeping this option enabled renders the full thread geometry, which significantly slows down the model and increases file size.",Always uncheck “Modeled” in the Thread feature to optimize performance,Any threaded custom component
LRN-2025-07-23-09,CAD / Naming Convention,Use Fusion ViewCube Labels to Indicate Component Positions,"The Fusion 360 ViewCube in the top-right corner defines six orientation labels: TOP, FRONT, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, BACK. These labels should be reused when naming identical components placed in different positions within an assembly (e.g. trusses).","Use only ViewCube terms (TOP, FRONT, etc.) to define positional variants of identical components",Any symmetrical assembly
LRN-2025-07-23-10,CAD / Traceability,Avoid Problematic URLs in Description Field,"When inserting purchase links into the Description field of a component, avoid using URLs that contain commas or are excessively long. Some suppliers (e.g., Dold Mechatronik) generate links with commas, which can break CSV structure during exports or imports.","Do not use links with commas in the Description. Use clean, short URLs suitable for CSV handling.",Any component with a purchase URL
LRN-2025-07-23-11,CAD / QA,Verification of CAD Models Against Real Components,"Before finalizing assemblies or generating manufacturing drawings, the CAD model must be verified against the real parts in stock or purchased. Suppliers may provide outdated or inaccurate CAD files.",Always verify the CAD model with real-world components before release or production,All externally sourced parts
LRN-2025-07-23-12,CAD / Naming,Avoid Embedding Variable Dimensions in File Names,"File names should avoid including values that are parametrically defined, such as length. Static names are acceptable for fixed supplier parts, but not for in-house parametric components.",Do not embed parameter values like length in file names unless the part is static and vendor-defined.,Parametric profile components
